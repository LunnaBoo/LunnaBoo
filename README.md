## ✦│Currently
Scholarship student at 42 Rio completing Common Core and developing side projects as part of scholarship requirements.\
Most of my repos are private since they're 42 projects.\
The public ones are projects I'm allowed to share or personal.

I have a solid programming base in **C**.\
I'm learning **JavaScript** and **Python**.\
I also have a linux problem. (Arch btw)
