## ✦│Currently
Scholarship student at 42 Rio completing Common Core and developing \
side projects as part of scholarship requirements. \
Most of my repos are private since they're 42 projects.\
The public ones are projects I'm allowed to share or personal.    

I have a solid programming base in **C**.                      
I'm learning **JavaScript** and **Python**.\
I also have a linux problem. (Arch btw)
